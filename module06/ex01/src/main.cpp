/**
 *  The subject mentions that we have to use a "static class Serializer with the
 *  following methods".
 *  The concept of "static class" does not exist in c++ and it cannot mean a
 *  class comprising only static members since a "the following methods" is
 *  requested, and a method corresponding to an virtual member it cannot be
 *  static.
 *
 *  I decided to create a Serializer with static member functions so I can use
 *  them without needing to instantiate my class.
 *
 *  I choose to use the reinterpret_cast because it is the most permissive, it
 *  allows downcast and therefore it is the most suitable for retyping
 *  information that comes without its type.
