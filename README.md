# C++ POOL

This project aims to familiarize with the syntax of the CPP as well as the
basics of the OOP. It is also a personal reference for the standard and "best
practices" that I was able to discover along the way starting with the most
restricted use possible (within the limits of the instructions imposed by the
exercises) of **getters and setters which go against the principle of
encapsulation**.
