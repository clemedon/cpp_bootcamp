/**
 * TODO should I follow the private or public data members naming convention for
 * protected data members ?
 *
 * Copy Assignment Operator:
 *
 *  Animal* cat = new Cat();
 *  Animal* dog = new Dog();
 *  *cat = *dog; // OK an animal can be a cat or a dog
 *
 *  Animal* cat;
 *  - cat          type is   Animal*
 *  - *cat         type is   Animal
 *  - *cat = *dog  type is   Animal = Animal
 *
 *  Cat* cat = new Cat();
 *  Dog* dog = new Dog();
 *  *cat = *dog;  // NOK a cat can not be a dog
 *  cat = dog;    // NOK only assign an address
 *
 * I preferred to build the classes through a parameter to the constructor
 * because if I had been satisfied to use the initialization of the parents'
 * _type data member inherited by the children then the construction of a child
 * class would always be preceded by a class with a wrongly defined type
 * (ex. constructed cat: construct animal > construct cat > ... > destroy cat >
 * destroy *cat*) which gives an asymmetric output.
