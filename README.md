# C++ POOL

This project aims to familiarize with the syntax of the CPP as well as the
basics of the OOP. It is also a personal reference for the standard and "best
practices" that I was able to discover and choose along the way starting with
the greatest possible respect for the principle of encapsulation which
translates, among other things, into the most restricted use possible (within
the limits of the instructions imposed by the exercises) of **getters and
setters**.
